## Problem Statement

The task at hand is to predict future sales for product and service-based businesses. Given the dynamic nature of the market, businesses must anticipate sales figures based on factors such as advertising expenses, audience targeting, and advertising platform choices.

**Challenges**

1. **Variable Impact of Advertising**: Understanding how varying levels of advertising expenditure affect sales.
2. **Audience Segmentation**: Identifying and analyzing diverse audience segments to predict their impact on sales.
3. **Platform Optimization**: Determining the best advertising platforms to maximize sales outcomes.

**Objective**

Develop a machine learning model using Python to predict future sales. The model will offer actionable insights into the relationships between advertising investments, audience segments, and advertising platforms with sales figures.

## Project Summary
